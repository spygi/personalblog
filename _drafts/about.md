My version of "Today I Learned" with a broader scope: usually it's work that spans over some days/weeks rather than a single day. I find it helps my understanding to put multiple things in context against other things so I like to gather some topics on a specific subject before writing.

The name? I used to party (more) - offtopic: I hate the phrase _I party_. But.. code should feel more like a party and not like a drag (bad jokes, that's definitely me). Batman? That's what I wanted to become when I grow up üôÉ

Topics that interest me are Web Development (front-back and devops), data and possibly mobile development. You can find more about me [here](http://spygi.me).

### Disclaimer
Don't expect exactly groundbreaking content nor polished presentation/writing here. Most of the posts will feel a little bit "drafty" or "simple". That's ok. I am doing this for me as an exercise a) to get more into (technical) writing and b) to remember better what I am working on as I find the effort of writing it down in a concise manner helps me. If the topics are too easy for you, great you are a maybe a better dev than me üëçüèª. If the posts are "ugly": I don't expect people to randomly follow this blog but please complain on the comments and maybe I will take this blog a bit more seriously :) Last but not least, if I want to share a specific piece or someone (e.g. recruiter) wants/asks to see some of my work, having a blog makes it at least "presentable".

That said, I would greatly appreciate comments (or even PRs if someone has a lot of free time on the [Github repo](https://github.com/spygi/tech-blog) backing this blog).

### Positioning: why here?
I thought of Medium as a platform but dislike the editor (too limited functionality, no?) and in general it seems a very closed platform. Also through the integration with Github pages, the blog "lives closer" to the actual code (not a significant advantage but still).

I do have [a Medium publication](https://medium.com/@spygi) for non-tech topics (or tech but higher level). And for technical topics that I don't have enough context, less grasp of the matter or not enough time to form a post, I maintain some [tech notes on Github](https://github.com/spygi/documentation).
