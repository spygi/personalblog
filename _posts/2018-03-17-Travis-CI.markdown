[Travis](https://travis-ci.com) is a CI/CD tool originally made for open source projects. Now there is also an offering for commercial/private repositories tool, travis-ci.com (versus org). I used Travis for this site (deployed on Github pages) and for my main site (deployed with Heroku).

## On Github side
+ On the repo you want to publish, go to Settings -> Integrations & services and add a new Service: `username: spygi` (I guess this is of Travis?), token from [your Travis profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile/spygi), `domain: notify.travis-ci.org`. Test the service to check if it works.
+ Generate a [Github token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). You need only `repo` and `admin:repo_hook` rights I think.

## On Travis side
+ On [your Travis profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile/spygi) flip the switch on for the repo in question.

## Locally
+ Generate a `.travis.yml` file e.g. [the one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spygi/tech-blog/master/.travis.yml) used for this site.
+ `gem install travis`
+ Within the repo: `travis encrypt 'GIT_NAME="YOUR_USERNAME" GIT_EMAIL="YOUR_EMAIL" GH_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN'` and put it into the `.travis.yml`
+ Push and check status on  https://travis-ci.org/USERNAME/REPO.
